  q1: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'Watching his reflection in the darkening windowpane, David thinks that people say he looks like a man with nothing to hide — and that they are wrong: his ordinary, trustworthy face conceals everything.',
    scene: 'Scene 1 — The House in the South of France',
    chapter: 'Part One, Chapter One',
    meaning: 'From the first page David’s identity is split in two: an acceptable surface and a hidden self. The whole novel measures the cost of that concealment.',
  },
  q2: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'The whole story is told in a single night: David waits alone in a rented house in the south of France, and at dawn, in Paris, Giovanni will be executed by the guillotine.',
    scene: 'Scene 1 — The House in the South of France',
    chapter: 'Part One, Chapter One',
    meaning: 'Baldwin frames the memory with its consequence. Before the story even “begins,” David’s refusal to express his true self has already cost a life.',
  },
  q3: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'As a teenager in Brooklyn, David spends one tender night with his friend Joey — and wakes up ashamed, terrified of what such love would make him. He mocks Joey, drives him away, and begins a flight from himself that lasts for years.',
    scene: 'Scene 2 — Childhood Memory: Father',
    chapter: 'Part One, Chapter One',
    meaning: 'Shame teaches David his first lesson: that his real feelings must be punished and buried. It is the original wound of his hidden identity.',
  },
  q4: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'David’s father insists that all he wants is for his son to grow up to be a real man. Yet he never really asks who David is inside, only whether David can perform the role expected of him.',
    scene: 'Scene 2 — Childhood Memory: Father',
    chapter: 'Part One, Chapter One',
    meaning: 'Manhood, in David’s home, is a performance to be delivered, not an identity to be discovered. The pressure to act a part follows David across the ocean.',
  },
  q5: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'Jacques warns David that love can only become real if David stops treating it as shameful. If David keeps choosing safety over honesty, he will end up alone, unable to truly love anyone.',
    scene: 'Scene 3 — Guillaume’s Bar',
    chapter: 'Part One, Chapter Three',
    meaning: 'Jacques names the novel’s central choice: love expressed without shame can ennoble, but love denied out of shame imprisons. David hears the warning — and ignores it.',
  },
  q6: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'From the moment David sees Giovanni behind the bar, the evening changes. Talking with Giovanni feels alive and dangerous because David’s careful, controlled self begins to slip.',
    scene: 'Scene 3 — Guillaume’s Bar',
    chapter: 'Part One, Chapter Two',
    meaning: 'Genuine feeling arrives like illumination: with Giovanni, David briefly stops performing. The meeting shows the self David could express — and will spend the novel running from.',
  },
  q7: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'David remembers that life in Giovanni’s room felt separated from the outside world. Time lost its normal shape there, and David felt himself changing inside those four walls.',
    scene: 'Scene 4 — Giovanni’s Room',
    chapter: 'Part Two, Chapter One',
    meaning: 'The room is the one place where David’s true self surfaces — which is exactly why it terrifies him. Becoming himself feels to David like drowning.',
  },
  q8: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'Giovanni has painted over the windowpanes, so the room keeps the outside world away and keeps what happens inside hidden.',
    scene: 'Scene 4 — Giovanni’s Room',
    chapter: 'Part Two, Chapter Two',
    meaning: 'The whitened windows show secrecy and isolation: love that must be hidden from the world slowly suffocates the people inside it.',
  },
  q9: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'Hella comes back from Spain wanting an ordinary, settled life — marriage, children, and a clear place in the world — and David clings to her as proof that he can still be the man everyone expects.',
    scene: 'Scene 5 — Hella’s Return',
    chapter: 'Part Two, Chapter Four',
    meaning: 'Hella stands for the safe, conventional future. David does not choose her out of love but out of fear — using her life as a shield against his own.',
  },
  q10: {
    kind: 'Paraphrase',
    text: 'On the morning of Giovanni’s execution, David tears up the letter about Giovanni’s death, but the wind blows some of the torn pieces back onto him.',
    scene: 'Scene 5 — The Choice',
    chapter: 'Part Two, Chapter Five',
    meaning: 'The novel’s last image: guilt cannot be torn up and thrown away. The consequences of a denied identity return to David no matter how he tries to scatter them.',
